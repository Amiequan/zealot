        This documentation doesn't provide a way to test our API. In order to facilitate testing, we recommend the following tools:

        - [cURL](https://curl.se/) (recommended, command-line)
        - [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/)
        - [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
        - Your web browser, if you don't need to send headers or a request body

        Once you have a working client, you can test that it works by making a GET request to {host}/version:

        ```json
        {
          "version": "5.2.3",
          "vcs_ref": "effe99c25b79fd55d3e1959ea3af0bcb6b75ba1d",
          "build_date": "2024-05-23T06:04:48.989Z"
        }
        ```

        ## Authentication

        This API only accepts one options for authentication: Personal access tokens.
        All tokens are tied to a Zealot user and use the `token` query of the request.

        Example:

        ```
        https://tryzealot.ews.im/api/users?token={token}
        ```

        ### Personal access tokens

        Personal access tokens (PATs) can be found in from the [user settings](/docs/user-guide/user_settings).
